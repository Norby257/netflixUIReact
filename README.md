# Project

This is a React app that is modeled after the Netflix UI. 

 
 # Motivations 

 I wanted to re-create the User Interface of one of the most well known web applications. And add a few features that I would like to see, too! I enjoy developing in React and this was a fun project. This app uses the moviefb API (TMDb) to query movie and tv shows by various parameters. 
 More information about this API can found ![here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).


 # Installation 

 To enjoy this project, simply clone the repo and run `npm install`  followed by `npm start`.

 # Future Directions 

 Future directions with this application include: 
* Having a backend API (in progress!) 
* An aggregate count (such as Top Ten)
* Sorting by Genre
* A Search function
