# Project

This is a React app that is modeled after the Netflix UI. 

 
 # Motivations 

 I wanted to re-create the User Interface of one of the most well known web applications. And add a few features that I would like to see, too! I enjoy developing in React and this was a fun project. 


 # Installation 

 To enjoy this project, simply clone the repo and run `npm install`  followed by `npm start`.

 * Sorting by Genre
